<strong>Congratulations! That's all! You have just learned all the very basics of SuperMemo!</strong>

<p>Now you will need to trust the program for some time before you can see the effects of your work. Your trust will grow if you know how SuperMemo works (see: <a class=external href="http://www.supermemo.com/english/princip.htm" target=_new>Principles of SuperMemo</a>).</p>

<p>Use the <strong>Learn</strong> button (<em>Ctrl+L</em>) <font color=#ff0000><strong>daily</strong></font> to make sure you do not forget what you have learned.<br>
Use <strong>Add new</strong> (<em>Alt+A</em>) to add new questions and answers.</p>

<p>Do not forget to back-up your learning material from time to time. Use <strong>File : Copy collection</strong> (<em>Ctrl+Shift+C)</em> from the main menu to copy your material to some location on your hard disk. Or better yet: on a DVD-R or a flash drive.<br>
If you cannot see this option, you need to switch SuperMemo to a higher level that exposes some extra program functionality. E.g. to switch SuperMemo from the <strong>Beginner</strong> level (you are most likely in) to the next <strong>Basic</strong> level (in which the <strong>Copy collection</strong> menu item becomes visible), select <strong>File : Level : Beginner</strong>.<br>
Remember that you have two <strong>B</strong>-choices: <font style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffff80"><strong>Back up or Be sorry!</strong></font><br>
